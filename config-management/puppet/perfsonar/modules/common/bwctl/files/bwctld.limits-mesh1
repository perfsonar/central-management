# mesh1 bwctld limits

#	This is an EXAMPLE "limits" file for the bwctld process.
#
#	You SHOULD change this to meet the requirements for your local
#	deployment needs!
#
#	This example configuration allows Abilene measurement hosts to run
#	tests to your server, but will not allow you to run tests to your own
#	hosts. This is intentional so you will have to look at this file and
#	modifiy it.
#
#
#	Basics:
#	Almost the same as owampd - with the following limit types defined:
#
#	parent - specified which limit to inherit settings from
#	bandwidth - Sets the maximum UDP bandwidth
#	duration - Sets the maximum duration for tests
#	allow_open_mode - Allows unauthenticated users
#	allow_tcp - Allows for TCP tests
#	allow_udp - Allows for UDP tests
#       max_time_error - Sets the maximum time offset that the server will accept
#       minimum_ttl - Sets the minimum TTL for traceroute tests
#

# setup the root node with max bandwidth as open as possible.
# Super-user access
limit root with \
	bandwidth=900m, \
	duration=60, \
	allow_udp=on, \
	allow_tcp=on, \
	allow_open_mode=on, \
        max_time_error=20

# Disable UDP tests for non-authorized users. Unspecified values default to
# parent permissions
limit regular with parent=root, \
	allow_udp=off

# minimal everything
# send hackers and bad nets here
limit jail with parent=root, \
	bandwidth=1, \
	duration=1, \
	allow_udp=off, \
	allow_tcp=off, \
	allow_open_mode=off

# Default everything to regular user access
# this allows TCP for up to 60 seconds and 
# no UDP tests
assign default regular

# hacker and BBI networks
# this shows a 172.16 private address block being
# prohibited 
# see RFC 1918 for a descripton of private address blocks
assign net 172.16.10.0/24 jail

# localhost (and any other hosts you completely trust)
# (might as well trust localhost, the user could run iperf directly...)
assign net 127.0.0.1/32 root
assign net ::1/128  root
