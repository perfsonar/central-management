# default puppet mesh config

## Use 'mesh' blocks to to specify each mesh that the agent should
### configure the host against
##<mesh>
##    ## Use 'configuration_url' to specify the URL where the agent should obtain
##    ## the mesh configuration from
##    configuration_url             https://host.domain.edu/example.json   
##
##    ## To ensure that the configuration is trusted, you can set the
##    ## 'validate_certificate' option to 1. This will validate that the certificate
##    ## is valid, and matches the hostname. If the 'validate_certificate' option is
##    ## set to 1, the 'ca_certificate_file' option must be set.
##    #validate_certificate         0
##
##    ## The 'ca_certificate_file' specifies which CAs to use to validate the
##    ## certificates.
##    #ca_certificate_file          /etc/pki/tls/bundle.crt    # the default RedHat CAs
##
##    ## The 'required' field specifies that if this mesh isn't available, or has
##    ## problems, to skip making any changes to the host configuration.
##    #required              1
##
##    ## The 'permit_non_participation' specifies that if the host isn't
##    ## included in this mesh, the agent shouldn't thrown an error.
##    #permit_non_participation      1
##</mesh>
#
### You can define more meshes to configure against by adding more 'mesh' blocks.
##<mesh>
##    configuration_url             https://host.otherdomain.edu/mesh.json
##    #validate_certificate         0
##    #ca_certificate_file          /etc/pki/tls/bundle.crt
##</mesh>
#
### You can use the 'use_regular_testing' variable to disable having the mesh
### configuration generate the regular testing # configuration so that it will
### generate the traceroute master, owmesh and # pinger landmarks files instead.
### To do this, you'll need to set the variable to 0.
## use_regular_testing      1
#
### Use the 'regular_testing_conf' variable to change the location of the
### regular_testing.conf file that gets generated.  In a normal configuration,
### these should be left as what's included below.
## regular_testing_conf        /opt/perfsonar_ps/regular_testing/etc/regular_testing.conf
#
### Use the traceroute_master_conf, owmesh_conf and pinger_landmarks options to
### specify the location of the files to write. In a normal configuration, these
### should be left as what's included below.
## traceroute_master_conf       /opt/perfsonar_ps/traceroute_ma/etc/traceroute-master.conf
## owmesh_conf                  /opt/perfsonar_ps/perfsonarbuoy_ma/etc/owmesh.conf
## pinger_landmarks             /opt/perfsonar_ps/PingER/etc/pinger-landmarks.xml
#
### You can include one or more 'address' options to specify which address
### corresponds to this host. By default, the agent will attempt to guess the
### address using the hostname of the host, as well as the hostname IPs.
##address                      chic-pt1.es.net
#
## The 'restart_services' option can be used to specify whether the services
## should be restarted after their configuration is updated. If the
## 'use_toolkit' variable below is set to 0, you will need to use the
## 'cron-restart_services' cron script included in
## /opt/perfsonar_ps/mesh_config/doc to restart the services.
#restart_services             1
#
## The 'use_toolkit' option can be used to specify whether the agent should use
## the pS-Performance Toolkit's configuration daemon to save the configuration,
## and restart the services. If the agent is not installed on a toolkit
## instance, you will make sure that the configuration files listed above are
## all writable by user 'perfsonar'. The 'perfsonar' user cannot restart the
## services so you will need to disable 'restart_services' above, and use the
## 'cron-restart_services' cron script included in
## /opt/perfsonar_ps/mesh_config/doc to restart the services.
#use_toolkit                  1
#
## The 'send_error_emails' option can be used to tell the agent to send an email
## (via sendmail) when an error occurs. These emails will be sent to the
## applicable administrators (e.g. the local administrator(s), the mesh
## administrator(s), the site administrator(s), and/or the host
## administrator(s).
#send_error_emails             1
#
### By default, the from address for the error emails will be
### mesh_agent@[hostname]. However, if you'd like to specify a different email
### address, you can do so here.
##email_from_address           admin@host.site.edu
#
### One or more 'admin_email' options can be included to specify email addresses
### to send errors to. These email addresses will receive all errors (including
### parsing errors). This is in addition to the emails that will be sent to the
### various affected administrators (e.g. the mesh administrator or the site
### administrator).
##admin_email         admin1@site.edu
##admin_email         admin2@site.edu
#
#
### The 'skip_redundant_tests' can be used so that if the meshes end up creating
### multiple tests between hosts with the exact same test parameters, it will
### only setup the hosts to only run one test. If you enable this, you won't see
### the skipped tests in the Toolkit GUI
##skip_redundant_tests        1
